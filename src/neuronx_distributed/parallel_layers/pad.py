    Pads a generic model to function to a desired tensor parallelism degree by padding the number of attention heads.
    Returns the original model modified with padding.

    Uses 1-axis padding strategy: pads the sharded dim of the ParallelLinear layers to the size it would have been
     for the padded number of heads.

    Usage:
        When modifying the Attention layer, typically you must divide by TP degree like so:
        > self.num_heads = neuronx_dist_utils.divide(self.num_heads, get_tensor_model_parallel_size())

        This line must be modified like so:
        > self.num_heads = neuronx_dist_utils.divide(
            self.num_heads + get_number_of_extra_heads(self.num_heads, get_tensor_model_parallel_size()),
            get_tensor_model_parallel_size())

        Then, after initializing the model, you must call this wrapper:
        > model = get_model(config=desired_config)
        > model = pad_model(model, tp_degree=32, desired_config.num_heads)  # Use the model as desired after this point

        You can specify a specific layer or class for your model to pad, so you aren't unnecessarily padding.
        Typically, this layer will be your Attention layer
        > model = pad_model(model, tp_degree=32, desired_config.num_heads, wrapped_classes=[MyAttention])

        You can also specify a pad_hook_fn, to be called whenever encountering an instance of wrapped_class,
        passing in said instance as a parameter, along with the tgt_src_ratio (num_heads_padded / num_heads).
        > def my_hook(attention_to_pad, tgt_src_ratio):
        >   attention_to_pad.split_size = int(model.split_size * tgt_src_ratio)
        > model = pad_model(model, tp_degree=32, desired_config.num_heads, wrapped_classes=[MyAttention],
        >   pad_hook_fn=my_hook)

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): model to be padded
        tp_degree (int): tensor parallel degree
        n_heads (int): the number of heads the given model to be padded has. This can typically be found in the config
        wrapped_classes (Tuple[any], *optional*, defaults to `()`): tuple of classes (and their submodules) which
             should be padded
        pad_hook_fn (Callable[any, float], *optional*, defaults to `None`): a hook function that is called whenever
             encountering a class to pad. Receives an instance of the class to pad and the
             tgt_src_ratio (num_heads_padded / num_heads)as its argument
