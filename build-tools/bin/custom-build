# Options used:
#   --max-line-length=120 is used since a lot of docstrings
#   contain lines longer than 120 that wouldn't make sense
#   to split (ex. code snippets)
#
#   Warnings that are ignored
#   F401: unused import
#     - Reason to ignore: Side effects might occur on import.
#       Also, neuronx-cc check would trip this.
#   W503/504: newline before/after binary operator.
#     - Reason to Ignore: conditionals are often split into
#       multiple lines for readability).
